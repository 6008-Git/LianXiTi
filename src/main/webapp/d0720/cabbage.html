		</h2>


		<p>
			If we cut vertically through the middle of the head, we shall find it
			made up of successive layers of leaves, which grow smaller and
			smaller, almost
			<i>ad infinitum</i>. Now, if we take a fruit bud from an apple-tree
			and make a similar section of it, we shall find the same structure.
			If we observe the development of the two, as spring advances, we
			shall find another similarity (the looser the head the closer will be
			the resemblance),&mdash;the outer leaves of each will unwrap and
			unfold, and a flower stem will push out from each. Here we see that a
			cabbage is a bud, a seed bud (as all fruit buds may be termed, the
			production of seed being the primary object in nature, the fruit
			enclosing it playing but a secondary part), the office of the leaves
			being to cover, protect, and afterwards nourish the young seed shoot.
			The outer leaves which surround the head appear to have the same
			office as the leaves which surround the growing fruit bud, and that
			office closes with the first year, as does that of the leaves
			surrounding fruit buds, when each die and drop off. In my locality
			the public must have perceived more or less clearly the analogy
			between the heads of cabbage and the buds of trees, for when they
			speak of small heads they frequently call them "buds." That the close
			wrapped leaves which make the cabbage head and surround the seed
			germ, situated just in the middle of the head at the termination of
			the stump, are necessary for its protection and nutrition when young,
			is proved, I think, by the fact that those cabbages, the heads of
			which are much decayed, when set out for seed, no matter how sound
			the seed germ may be at the end of the stump, never make so large or
			healthy a seed shoot as those do the heads of which are sound; as a
			rule, after pushing a feeble growth, they die.

			Soil
		</h2>


		<p>
			Should the soil be a heavy clay, a deep fall ploughing is best, that
			the frosts of winter may disintegrate it; and should the plan be to
			raise an early crop, this end will be promoted by fall ploughing, on
			any soil, as the land will thereby be made drier in early spring. In
			New England the soil for cabbages should be ploughed as deep as the
			subsoil, and the larger drumheads should be planted only on the
			deepest soil. If the season should prove a favorable one, a good crop
			of cabbage may be grown on sod broken up immediately after a crop of
			hay has been taken from it, provided plenty of fine manure is
			harrowed in. One great risk here is from the dry weather that usually
			prevails at that season, preventing the prompt germination of the
			seed, or rooting of the plants. It is prudent in such a case to have
			a good stock of plants, that such as die may be promptly replaced. It
			is wise to plant the seed for these a week earlier than the main
			crop, for when transplanted to fill the vacant places it will take
			about a week for them to get well rooted.

			<a name="howtoapplythemanure" id="howtoapplythemanure"></a>How to
			Apply the Manure
		</h2>


		<p>
			Any manure but hog manure for cabbage,&mdash;barn manure, rotten
			kelp, night-soil, guano, fertilizers, wood ashes, fish, salt, glue
			waste, hen manure, slaughter-house manure. I have used all of these,
			and found them all good when rightly applied. My own practice is to
			use all my rich compost broadcast, and depend on guano, fertilizers,
			or hen manure in the hill. Let all guano, if at all lumpy, like the
			Peruvian, be sifted, and let all the hard lumps be reduced by
			pounding, until the largest pieces shall not be larger than half a
			pea, before it is brought upon the ground. My land being ready, the
			compost worked under and the rows marked out, I select three trusty
			hands who can be relied upon to follow faithfully my directions in
			applying so dangerous manure as guano is in careless or ignorant
			hands; one takes a bucket of it, and, if for large cabbage, drops as
			much as he can readily close in his shut hand, where each hill is to
			be; if for small sorts, then about half that quantity, spreading it
			over a circle about a foot in diameter; the second man follows with a
			pronged hoe, or better yet, a six-tined fork, with which he works the
			guano well into the soil, first turning it three or four inches under
			the surface, and then stirring the soil
			<em>very thoroughly</em> with the hoe or fork. Unless the guano (and
			this is also true of most fertilizers) is faithfully mixed up with
			the soil, the seed will not vegetate. Give the second man about an
			hour the start, and then let the third man follow with the seed.

			Young Plants
		</h2>


		<p>
			In four or five days, if the weather is propitious, the young plants
			will begin to break ground, presenting at the surface two leaves,
			which together make nearly a square, like the first leaves of turnips
			or radishes. As soon as the third leaf is developed, go over the
			piece, and boldly thin out the plants. Wherever they are very thick,
			pull a mass of them with the fingers and thumb, being careful to fill
			up the hole made with fine earth. After the fourth leaf is developed,
			go over the piece again and thin still more; you need specially to
			guard against a slender, weak growth, which will happen when the
			plants are too crowded. In thinning, leave the short-stumped plants,
			and leave them as far apart in the hill as possible, that they may
			not shade each other, or so interfere in growing as to make long
			stumps. If there is any market for young plants, thousands can be
			sold from an acre when the seed are planted in the hill; but in doing
			this bear in mind that your principal object is to raise cabbages,
			and to succeed in this the young plants must on no account be allowed
			to stand so long together in the hills as to crowd each other, making
			a tall, weak, slender growth,&mdash;getting "long-legged," as the
			farmers call it.

			Sour-Krout, Etc.
		</h2>


		<p>
			Cabbage when boiled with salt pork, as it is mostly used, is the food
			for strong and healthy digestive powers; but when eaten in its raw
			state, served with vinegar and pepper, it is considered one of the
			most easily digested articles of diet. In the process of cooking,
			even with the greatest care, a large portion of the sweetness is
			lost.
		</p>

		<p>
			To
			<em>Pickle</em>, select hard heads, quarter them, soak in salt and
			water four or five days, then drain and treat as for other pickles,
			with vinegar spiced to suit.
		</p>

		<p>
			For
			<em>Cold Slaw</em>, select hard heads, halve and then slice up these
			halves exceedingly fine. Lay these in a deep dish, and pour over
			vinegar that has been raised to the boiling point in which has been
			mixed a little pepper and salt.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Sour-Krout.</em> Take large, hard-headed drumheads, halve, and
			cut very fine; then pack in a clean, tight barrel, beginning with a
			sprinkling of salt, and following with a layer of cabbage, and thus
			alternating until the barrel is filled. Now compact the mass as much
			as possible by pounding, after which put on a well-fitting cover
			resting on the cabbage, and lay heavy weights or a stone on this.
			When fermented it is ready for use. To prepare for the table fry in
			butter or fat.
		</p>

		<p>
			The outer green leaves of cabbages are sometimes used to line a brass
			or copper kettle in which pickles are made in the belief that the
			vinegar extracts the coloring substance (chlorophyl) in the leaves,
			and the cucumbers absorbing this acquire a rich green color. Be not
			deceived by this transparent cheat, O simple housewife! the coloring
			matter comes almost wholly from the copper or brass behind those
			leaves; and, instead of an innocent vegetable pigment, your green
			cucumbers are dyed with the poisonous carbonate of copper.
